# Phone Interview Questions

### Tell me quirky about you

I would like to ask you a question

Have you ever used your annual leave to concentrate on solving a complex problem?

In other words, to work at home?

I did. I took an annual leave for three days to create a deep learning model.

By the way, the model is Deep Q Learning. 

As a senior researcher, I have lots of works to do beside mine at work. 

At that time, I needed time to focus, so I took an annual leave. 

My point is.. that I sometimes become totally crazy about what I do. 

Most of time, it is about research things. 



### Explain Google Cloud to a five years old

You like Lego right? It's really fun to play with Lego but putting away and organizing Lego is a little bit annoying. And sometimes you wanna play it with your friends but it is definitely hard to bring the toys to a friend's house. 

Cloud is like invisible person who organize your toys after your playing and take them anywhere wherever you go. All you have to do is to focus on playing! 



### Introduce yourself

Let me introduce myself quickly. 

My English name is Anderson. The name is taken from the Neo of the movie Matrix. His name was Anderson before going out of the Matrix. Maybe I might be a Neo someday. or maybe if I pass this interview. 

Currently I work for Exem in South Korea, as a senior A.I researcher. Recently I applied for a patent on Time2Vec which increase accuracy from about 60% to 98% on time-series data, and developed RetinaNet with P2 applied. The RetinaNet I made can detect objects with less than 16 pixels. and the accuracy is over 95%.  The model I made is being serviced in Google Cloud Machine Learning Engine. 



### Why Google?

I created a top-ranked game in the Google App Store and Kakao Game. 

Also I even put the third largest company to the top of list in terms of sales. 

Recently I applied a patent on my deep learning model and made an object detection model model which can detect tiny objects with high accuracy. I have always show my ability as successful results in this industry so far.  I know how to succeed and make good softwares. I think it is not strange even if I work for Google.
