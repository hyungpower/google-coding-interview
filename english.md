### Tell me quirky about you

I would like to ask you a question

Have you ever used your annual leave to concentrate on solving a complex problem?

In other words, to work at home?

I did. I took an annual leave for three days to create a deep learning model.

By the way, the model is Deep Q Learning. 

As a senior researcher, I have lots of works to do beside mine at work. 

At that time, I needed time to focus, so I took an annual leave. 

My point is.. that I sometimes become totally crazy about what I do. 

Most of time, it is about research things.
