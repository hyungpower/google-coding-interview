def test_longest_palindromic_substring():
    """
    This article is for intermediate readers.
    It introduces the following ideas: Palindrome, Dynamic Programming and String Manipulation.
    Make sure you understand what a palindrome means.
    A palindrome is a string which reads the same in both directions.
    For example, "aba" is a palindrome, "abc" is not.

    Given a string s, find the longest palindromic substring in s.
    You may assume that the maximum length of s is 1000.

    Example 1
    ```
        Input: "babad"
        Output: "bab"
        Note: "aba" is also a valid answer.
    ```

    Example 2
    ```
        Input: "cbbd"
        Output: "bb"
    ```
